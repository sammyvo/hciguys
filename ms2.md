## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work          

__1. Task/Problem Definition__

*Introduction of Problem*



*Potential Users*

The user population that will be affected by our problem of study includes students and professors. These users will perform tasks such as creating and replying to posts, upvoting posts as helpful, organizng posts by topic, and replying to discussion posts. Leveraging a Piazza-like interface within ELC will benefit users by allowing them to use one platform instead of having to rely on a third party system. Being integrated into the main course management system affords users to easily click into the discussion board, rather than need to log into a separate service. The more users that leverage these features, the more discussion that can be fostered as a result. This can lead to more impactful face to face interactions, all leading to impactful learning for students to benefit from.

*Potential Guidelines and Principles*

After reviewing existing solutions, Slack has the most comprehensive list of guidelines and principles. Slack lists three main aspects to digital product design: User-centered problem solving, User interface and experience design, and Collaboration and communication. In the next steps for this project, our group will adhere to the following guidelines and principles.

&emsp;i. User-Centered Problem Solving
* Empathy: Understanding how the user will be impacted before, during, and after using our product
* Goals, Anti-goals, and Audience: Consider different types of users and their potential objectives
* Problem Framing: Focus on why a user would have a problem in order to find the root cause of the issue
* Idea Generation: Produce diverse list of various approaches to the problem
* User testing, feedback, and validation: Create interactive prototype and collect user feedback
<br>

&emsp;ii. User Interface and Experience Design
* User experience (UX) design and user flows using wireframes
* Branding, visual, and user interface design following Gestalt Principles
* Motion and interaction design considering physical details and micro-interactions
* Accessibility: consider users with varying degrees and types of impairments
<br>

&emsp;iii. Collaboration and Communication
* Documentation: record design decisions at every level of product development
* Feedback and alignment: consider feedback while maintaining what is important for the product

__3. Proposed Solution__

As a general plan, develop an online discussion platform to support in-class learning that can be integrated into the Universites existing learning platform. This platform will blend helpful affordances from similar products such as Piazza, Slack, and Google Docs. In order to create one cohesive discussion platform, we will implement the following affordances:

* Create discussion posts individually or as a group
* Respond to discussion posts individually or as a group
* Live editing with support for mathematical symbols, expressions, characters, code, images, and links
* Upvoting or endorsing posts as helpful
* Users can save drafts of posts and return to them at a later time
* Instructor can organize discussion posts by variety of methods (date, chapter, topic, groups)
* Post search function to find keywords
* Users can filter posts by topic, group, or status
* Users will be able to mention other people by using the “@” to tag them
* Private chat function for live group discussion

*Measuring Success*

Our group will use the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
* Number of Users 
* Retention Rate
* Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) 
* Return On Investment (ROI) 
* Ratings/Reviews/Feedback
