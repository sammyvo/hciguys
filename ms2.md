## Milestone 2: Definition & Related Work          

### __1. Task/Problem Definition__

> *Introduction of Problem*

For facilitating discussions across a variety of courses, instructors may opt to use a discussion-board system to allow all students in the course to voice their thoughts. While UGA leverages the D2L (eLC) system for course management, the built-in discussion board is often left unused in favor of a third-party solution known as Piazza.

The built-in discussion board on eLC lacks several important affordances:
* No master search function for all posts regarding a topic
* Decreased opportunity for open-discussion questions and topics due to the design requiring instructors to setup specific topics before threads can be made
* Complicated design requires the use of more inputs to achieve a desired goal
* Lack of helpful signifiers on key features of the discussion board (ie. Instructor endorsed this, or upvoting a thread, or marking a response as “helpful”) 

Using a third party discussion board can cause problems for both instructors and students. Users may feel inconvenienced by needing to fill out and sign up for another service to accomplish a task, rather than being able to use systems with comparable features built-in. With a rising number of website breach incidents, users are becoming increasingly hesitant on sharing personal information, even at a basic level (ie. Email, First and Last Name). Once the new account is created, users encounter more issues with workflow and maintenance. Workflow transitions from one interface to another may constitute to a decrease in productivity (ie. changing websites to log into another service). Additionally, utilizing a third-party solution may create additional work for instructors such as managing another service, ensuring roster is complete on secondary platform, managing roles for TAs, and related tasks.

Discussion boards facilitate an interactive in-class experience. Using a digital system allows each students to voice their thoughts, rather than a select number physically responding in class, potentially leaving out some students from sharing their thoughts. It allows for collaboration among peers, with the ability for the entire class to see posts from multiple perspectives. Using a system such as this allows students to retroactively look back at their responses to further deepen their understanding on course materials. Particularly for larger section classes, using a discussion board allows for a large pool of students to be able to assist other students, leaving instructors the ability to endorse an answer, and potentially lessen their workload. 

> *Typical Use Case*

I. A Typical Interaction on ELC (Making a New Post):

Goal: User would like to make a new post on the board about a course topic that was not explicitly discussed.

Execution:
* Plan: User will log into their normal ELC account to create the post. 
* Specify: User can go on their mobile device, or their computer on a web browser to complete this task.
* Perform: User logs into ELC, goes over to “Discussions”, finds the relevant subject matter, and creates a new thread. 

World: User waits for their peer(s), TAs, Instructors to respond to their post with a response. 

Evaluation:
* Perceive: User will see their post and will assess the results of incoming responses. User will need to refresh the webpage as the responses are not “Live” fed. 
* Interpret: User will interpret the incoming responses to find the information they are looking for. 
* Compare: User will compare the responses with their expectation for the type of response they are looking for. If necessary, they will provide more information to granulate the incoming responses. 

II. A Typical Interaction on Piazza (Making a New Post):

Goal: User would like to make a new post on the board about a course topic that was not explicitly discussed.

Execution:
* Plan: User will go on Piazza, create a new post with the topic in the title itself. They will need to login to Piazza and create the post. If user does not have an account, they will need to create one. 
* Specify: User can go on their mobile device, or their computer on a web browser to complete this task.
* Perform: User logins in, clicks “New Post”, fills in the required information, and clicks “Post”. 

World: User waits for their peer(s), TAs, Instructors to respond to their post with a response. 

Evaluation:
* Perceive: User will see their post and will assess the results of incoming responses. Responses coming in are “Live” fed and a refresh of the webpage is not required. 
* Interpret: User will interpret the incoming responses to find the information they are looking for. 
* Compare: User will compare the responses with their expectation for the type of response they are looking for. If necessary, they will provide more information to granulate the incoming responses. 

Evaluation of Use Cases:

eLC
* Built-In System / No Additional Log-In Needed / No Sign-Ups Needed / No Change in Website
* Narrow-Focus: Having predefined subjects / topics to be able to post about narrows the type of questions that can be asked (relevant to the course that is). 
* To achieve the same task completion, there is an added number of steps for users to complete. 
* Responses posted are not done “Live” fed.

Piazza
* Third Party System / Requires Logging into, Signing Up for Another Site / Different Website
* Wider-Focus: A uniform board style can facilitate more open-discussion questions among peers. 
* To achieve the task completion, the number of steps is minimal. Responses are “Live” fed. 

> *Claims*

Claim: Relevance of Face to Face and Class Discussion Boards
* Discussion boards can be leveraged in a face to face setting for students to contribute to a class discussion in a method that allows retroactive viewing, ability for all students to participate, facilitates collaboration among peers, and provides a vessel for instructors to showcase to the entire class. 
* According to an NCBI Research Paper, discussion in a face to face setting encourages deeper learning, provides a channel for increased user engagement, and helps facilitate meaningful collaboration among peers. 
* Although this paper discusses the face to face class discussions from the perspective of a vocal setting, the combination of both a digital presence for all students to contribute to, with a showcase and vocal discussion, can provide meaningful impact for course discussion, with the ability to go back later and digest further. 

Claim: Reluctance of Users Signing Up for Services
* Users weigh the benefits to costs of signing up for another platform to complete a task. 
* Some users may consider the hassle of needing to sign up for another service, may not provide them with the value they seek. 
* This creates a dilemma of a built in service not being used in favor of a third party service that needs to be signed up for. 

Claim: Reluctance of Users Sharing Even Basic Personal Information
* Basic Personal Information Meaning: Email / Password / First and Last Name
* In a world with a rising number of data breaches on websites, users are becoming more reluctant with handing out personal information, even at the most basic level as it is still identifying information. 
* According Anthony (2014), only 54% of users are willing to even share their email address. 
* Third Party System is required to follow their own data compliance standards. 
* ELC conforms to tight data compliance standards in accordance to State / Federal Law. 
* The less places information is, the less chance there is of it popping up in website breach leaks. 


> *Potential Users*

The user population that will be affected by our problem of study includes students and professors. These users will perform tasks such as creating and replying to posts, upvoting posts as helpful, organizng posts by topic, and replying to discussion posts. Leveraging a Piazza-like interface within ELC will benefit users by allowing them to use one platform instead of having to rely on a third party system. Being integrated into the main course management system affords users to easily click into the discussion board, rather than need to log into a separate service. The more users that leverage these features, the more discussion that can be fostered as a result. This can lead to more impactful face to face interactions, all leading to impactful learning for students to benefit from.

> *Potential Guidelines and Principles*

After reviewing existing solutions, Slack has the most comprehensive list of guidelines and principles. Slack lists three main aspects to digital product design: User-centered problem solving, User interface and experience design, and Collaboration and communication. In the next steps for this project, our group will adhere to the following guidelines and principles.

&emsp;I. User-Centered Problem Solving
* Empathy: Understanding how the user will be impacted before, during, and after using our product
* Goals, Anti-goals, and Audience: Consider different types of users and their potential objectives
* Problem Framing: Focus on why a user would have a problem in order to find the root cause of the issue
* Idea Generation: Produce diverse list of various approaches to the problem
* User testing, feedback, and validation: Create interactive prototype and collect user feedback
<br>

&emsp;II. User Interface and Experience Design
* User experience (UX) design and user flows using wireframes
* Branding, visual, and user interface design following Gestalt Principles
* Motion and interaction design considering physical details and micro-interactions
* Accessibility: consider users with varying degrees and types of impairments
<br>

&emsp;III. Collaboration and Communication
* Documentation: record design decisions at every level of product development
* Feedback and alignment: consider feedback while maintaining what is important for the product


### __3. Proposed Solution__
> *Our Solution*

As a general plan, develop an online discussion platform to support in-class learning that can be integrated into the Universites existing learning platform. This platform will blend helpful affordances from similar products such as Piazza, Slack, and Google Docs. In order to create one cohesive discussion platform, we will implement the following affordances:

* Create discussion posts individually or as a group
* Respond to discussion posts individually or as a group
* Live editing with support for mathematical symbols, expressions, characters, code, images, and links
* Upvoting or endorsing posts as helpful
* Users can save drafts of posts and return to them at a later time
* Instructor can organize discussion posts by variety of methods (date, chapter, topic, groups)
* Post search function to find keywords
* Users can filter posts by topic, group, or status
* Users will be able to mention other people by using the “@” to tag them
* Private chat function for live group discussion

> *Measuring Success*

Our group will use the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
* Number of Users 
* Retention Rate
* Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) 
* Return On Investment (ROI) 
* Ratings/Reviews/Feedback
