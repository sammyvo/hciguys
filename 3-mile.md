## Milestone 3: Design Alternatives         

### __A. User Experience Requirements__

> *User Stories*

**1. Group Work**

User Type: Student

As a student, I would like to collaborate with my classmates in real time using rich markup tools so that I can effectively complete due assignments in a collaborative environment.

**2. Class Discussion**

User Type: Student

As a student, I would like to contribute to the class discussion to participate, add to the discussion, and / or voice my stance on a subject matter.

**3. Ask Questions**

User Type: Student

As a student, I would like to ask questions to the entire class for anyone to respond so I can receive a wide variety of responses.

**4. View Previous Discussions**

User Type: Student or Instructor

As a user of the system, I would like to be able to view and search previous discussion topics easily, in retrospect to view previous posts. 

**5. Pin Key Threads**

User Type: Instructor

As an instructor, I would like to pin important threads to the top for key notes for students to inform of important topics or posts.

**6. Facilitate Discussion**

User Type: Instructor

As an instructor, I would like for all my students to be able to contribute to a discussion to facilitate class participation and hear from all students in the course.

**7. Answer Questions**

User Type: Instructor

As an instructor, I would like to answer student questions and have public answers available for anyone to see to be able to answer repeated questions less.

**8. Endorse Responses**

User Type: Instructor

As an instructor, I would like to endorse student responses for all students to see to highlight great responses that are on point.

> *Relevance to Project*

**1. Group Work**

In today’s digital equipped world, students would like to easily collaborate with one another using rich real time collaborative tools. Tools like Google Drive and the associated tools allow for simple, effective collaboration.

**2. Class Discussion**

Students in a classroom and online setting would like to be able to contribute their ideas to a class discussion, class topics, and voice their stance on a particular subject.

**3. Ask Questions**

Students that ask public questions, would like to ask questions similar to raising your hand in class. This can extend to outside of the classroom outside the class time even for face to face settings to keep the learning in and out of the classroom.

**4. View Previous Discussions**

Users would like to be able to search and view discussions in retrospect to review and deepen their understanding on a course topic or subject. Similar to an instructor writing on the board and students taking notes to review later. Instructors may use this to see the type of questions that were asked on Piazza to influence and broaden their approach to delivering information for subsequent classes.

**5. Pin Key Threads**

Instructors would like to be able to pin key threads similar to sticky notes or headlines in class to keep in mind. This is similar to the ELC reminders or pins that an instructor may opt to pin to the course for students to see.

**6. Facilitate Discussion**

Instructors have the goal for classroom learning to be deep and meaningful for all students To facilitate discussion, instructors may want all students to contribute to the discussion to keep the conversation going and among all students.

**7. Answer Questions**

Instructors often receive the same questions repeatedly and often answer with the same exact response. To reduce the same questions from being asked, being able to answer questions with a special “instructor” marking will let all students in the system see the response.

**8. Endorse Responses**

In this open setting, students and instructors all contribute to what is posted. Students may answer student questions and instructors being able to endorse responses will let other students know that a particular response is endorsed by them.

> *Justifications for Design Choices*

Discussion Board
<ul>
	<li>Building upon the wireframe from the earlier sub-deliverable, part B, the idea here was to build an evolution over the current system being used by ELC. The focus? - Simple, clean, with an interface that clearly defines aspects of affordances and signifiers.</li>
<li>The intent was to design a piazza-esque style discussion board that is integrated with the ELC System.</li>
	<li>Affordances and Signifiers:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Side Pane (Left Side):</li>
<ul>
<li>Affordances: There is a simple thread list with a create post button, a drop-down for topic style (general, group, etc.), and a unified search bar to search threads. This affords the user the ability to search and create threads from the sidebar similar to other discussion boards and leverages a unified interface rather than the split-page style ELC uses now. The intent is to remove unnecessary steps for using the system. </li>
<li>Signifiers: The signifier for the pin threads is represented with a “pin” logo to show these are where the pinned threads would be located. The search bar is a traditional look to signify that a user can search threads here to filter specific keywords, topics, similar to how Piazza does it now. The intent here is to allow for a seamless search, removing unnecessary steps (i.e. querying a search and waiting for results on a separate page). </li></ul>
	<li>Main Pane (Right Side):</li>
<ul>
<li>Affordances: POV is to be from an administrator's perspective to show additional features that a student user would not see. This main pane has inputs to pin threads and respond to threads. The intent here is to keep a simple and content-focused approach with the main affordances of viewing the thread material, pinning the thread (for capable users), and responding to the thread itself. </li>
<li>Signifiers: The empty pin is to signify that this is NOT a pinned thread and a shaded pin icon would signify that this is a pinned thread. Additionally, specific keywords in areas are used to break up the display of information to signify the relevant thread information - ie. if you are looking for the follow-up discussions to the thread, read under the “Followup Discussions” header. Additional signifiers are used such as the “read more” in blue to show more of the individual responses. Each response is condensed showing some information to keep the interface clutter-free. <li></ul>
	<li>Additional Justifications for Design:</li>
<ul>
<li>The color palette used is to be integrated into the ELC system to keep a consistent and familiar look. The intention is to not present a jarring interface design that deters from the ELC - causing a distraction to the user using the system. </li>
<li>Similar to the course pages in ELC, the intent is to feel familiar to use while affording the user the power to have a discussion board to broaden their learning within a course setting. </li>
<li>Notice the “Discussions” highlighted in the tab-pane. The intent is to jump the user right into the interface upon clicking. The current ELC system has multiple pages separating the threads and the responses. </li></ul>
